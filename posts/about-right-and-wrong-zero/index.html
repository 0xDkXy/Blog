            <p>The argument that it would be wrong is supposed to give
him a reson not to do it. But if someone just does not
care about other people, what reason does he have to refrain
from doing any of the things usually thought to be
wrong, if he can get away with it: waht reason does he have
not to kill, steal, lie, or hurt others? If he can get
what he wants by doing such things, why shouldn't he?
And if there is no reason why he shouldn't, in what sence
is wrong.</p>
<p>Because if you admit that you would resent it if someone else
did to you what you are now doing to him, you are admitting
that you think he would have a reason not to do it to you.
And if you admit that, you have to consider what that reason
is. It couldn't be just that it's you that he's hurting,
of all the people in the world. There is no special reason
for him not to steal your umbrella, as opposed to anyone
else's. There is nothing so special about. Whatever the
reason is, it's a reason he would against hurting anyone
else in the same way. And it's a reason anyone else would
have too, in a similar situation, against hurting you or
anyone else.</p>
<p>But if it is a reason anyone would have not to hurt anyone 
else in this way, then it's a reason you have not to hurt 
someone else in this way (since anyone means everyone). 
Therefore, it's a reason not to steal the other person's
unbrella now.</p>
