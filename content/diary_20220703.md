My diary in 2022-07-12  
It's the first day writing my diary in English

<!-- more -->

To practice my English writing and use English as much as possible, 
I decide to write a diary to record my daily life and feeling per day.
So, it's the first day, and it's also a common day. Today is Sunday, but the weather  
is not sunny. It was said that there would come a typhoon this weekends,  
but it just rained yesterday, and cloud today. I am a little sad because worrying  
rainy tonight, I didn't go to play football with my upperclassman.  
It's been a long time since I last played football, almost half year?


So much I want to write, but just write here today.

See you tomorrow guys.
