My diary in 2022-07-07

Brilliant! Haha! I compiled the source code and executed it successfully! Wow!

<!-- more -->

Aha! Finally I solved the problem that could not compile the CGAL dynamic link lib!

So brilliant guys.Haha. But, actually I just do this work during the rest time of reading my papers, hardly working.

Another remarkable event is that I will have a gathering in tomorrow evening with my best friends! 

I decide to practice coding by solving the daily problem in leetcode 
starting from tomorrow. Just for fun.

That's all. Good night guys.

Bye!
