My diary in 2022-07-04  

The second day, also a rainy day.

<!-- more -->

Feeling a little relaxed,
it's START (the department I intern) four years anniversary.
Receiving some souvenirs like a bag,
a ID card cover and so on,
all designed by START, it's fantastic. 

Whereas there are something terrible like installing boost lib and CGAL lib on Windows.
It's totally a suffering for me. Why windows still exist? 
Like rubbish. It's so hard to use it to develop.
I can't tolerate **no package manager** on it. It's to bad!

Well, it's late now.I gonna to sleep, see you tomorrow guys.

Good night!

**Tips:**  
it seems like a cheetsheet rather than diary haha, funny.
