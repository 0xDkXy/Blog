My diary in 2022-07-05

Still not solve the error of linking dynamic lib.
What a sad day!

<!-- more -->

A sad day, I still can not solve the problem that when the executable file con not link to the dynamic lib.
And I also fail in compiling the source code of the dependencies to dynamic lib.
So deep sad.

I do not want to write more because of the terrible things. 

That's all about today. What a sad day again.

See you tomorrow guys. Wish you a good night.

Bye.
