My diary in 2022-07-06

Fuck covid-19 and the xx gov.

<!-- more -->

During today and yesterday, the city I live now appear a covid-19 patient.
I have a spite against the covid-19. It makes so many peoples' life abnormal, people can not go where they want, and must wear the respirators all always. Probably can not walk out of the house if the status become worse.

Are we still free? Perhaps, but I don't think so.

Another thing that is meaningful is that we pals begin use English in 
daily communication. It may help to raise our English.

So much for today, see you guys.
